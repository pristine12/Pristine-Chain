<p style="font-size: 20px; color:white;">  We were crazy to think   <br>
    We were crazy to think<br>
    Crazy to think that this could work<br>
    Remember how I said I'd die for you?<br>
    We were stupid to jump<br>
    In the ocean separating us<br>
    Remember how I'd fly to you?<br>
    And I can't talk to you when you're like this<br>
    Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town<br>
    I'm New York City<br>
    I still do it for you, babe<br>
    They all warned us about times like this<br>
    They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith<br>
    Blind faith<br>
    But we might just get away with it<br>
    Religion's in your lips<br>
    Even if it's a false god<br>
    We'd still worship<br>
    We might just get away with it<br>
    The altar is my hips<br>
    Even if it's a false god<br>
    We'd still worship this love<br>
    We'd still worship this love<br>
    We'd still worship this love<br>
    I go there when you touch me<br>
    Honey hell is when I fight with you<br>
    But we can patch it up good<br>
    Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness<br>
    Got the wine for you<br>
    And you can't talk to me when I'm like this<br>
    Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you<br>
    You're the West Village<br>
    You still do it for me, babe<br>
    They all warned us about times like this<br>
    They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith<br>
    Blind faith<br>
    But we might just get away with it<br>
    Religion's in your lips<br>
    Even if it's a false god<br>
    We'd still worship<br>
    We might just get away with it<br>
    The altar is my hips<br>
    Even if it's a false god<br>
    We'd still worship this love<br>
    We'd still worship this love<br>
    We'd still worship this love, ah<br>
    Still worship this love<br>
    Even if it's a false god<br>
    Even if it's a false god<br>
    Still worship this love<br>
