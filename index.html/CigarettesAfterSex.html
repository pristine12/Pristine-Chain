        <u>Lyric</u>
<p style="font-size: 20px; color:white;"> You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust <br>
   
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above<br>

[Chorus]<br>
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why<br>
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why<br>
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms<br>
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark<br>

[Chorus]<br>
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why<br>
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why<br>
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye<br>

[Bridge]<br>
Your lips, my lips<br>
Apocalypse<br>
Your lips, my lips<br>
Apocalypse<br>
Go and sneak us through the rivers<br>
Flood is rising up on your knees<br>
Oh, please<br>
Come out and haunt me, I know you want me<br>
Come out and haunt me<br>
[Verse 3]<br>

Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids<br>
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist<br>

[Chorus]
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why<br>
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why<br>
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye<br>
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye<br>

[Outro]<br>
Oh, when you're all alone<br>
I will reach for <br>
When you're feeling low<br>
I will be there too<br>

    </p>
