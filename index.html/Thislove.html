<p style="font-size: 20px; color:white;">     Clear blue water <br>
    Clear blue water<br>
High tide came and brought you in<br>
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will<br>
Skies grew darker<br>
Currents swept you out again<br>
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone<br>
In silent screams<br>
In wildest dreams<br>
I never dreamed of this<br>
This love is good<br>
This love is bad<br>
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh<br>
These hands had to let it go free, and<br>
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh<br>
Ohh<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
Tossing, turning<br>

Struggled through the night with someone new<br>
And I could go on and on, on and on<br>
Lantern, burning<br>
Flickered in the night, only you<br>
But you were still gone, gone, gone<br>
In losing grip<br>
But you were still gone, gone, gone<br>
On sinking ships<br>
You showed up just in time<br>
This love is good<br>
This love is bad<br>
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh<br>
These hands had to let it go free, and<br>
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh<br>
This love left a permanent mark<br>
This love is glowing in the dark, oh, oh, oh<br>
These hands had to let it go free, and<br>
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh<br>
Your kiss, my cheek<br>
I watched you leave<br>
Your smile, my ghost<br>
I fell to my knees<br>
When you're young, you just run<br>
But you come back to what you need<br>
This love is good<br>
This love is bad<br>
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh<br>
These hands had to let it go free, and<br>
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh<br>
This love left a permanent mark<br>
This love is glowing in the dark, oh, oh, oh<br>
These hands had to let it go free, and<br>
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh<br>
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh<br>
